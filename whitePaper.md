​Introduction: A Novel Architecture for Blockchain
​Current blockchain networks, despite their revolutionary nature, face fundamental challenges including high energy consumption, slow transaction speeds, and limited scalability. Bitcoin, as the first and most widely known blockchain, relies on a scattered, competitive architecture that leads to immense energy waste and transaction delays.
​This white paper introduces a new blockchain architecture called the "Grid-based Blockchain Network." By systematically organizing network nodes and blocks, this design seeks to simultaneously achieve the core tenets of blockchain technology: security, speed, and decentralization.
​1. Network Architecture: The Grid Structure
​Unlike the scattered networks of today, our proposed architecture organizes network nodes into a layered grid of columns and rows. This structured layout optimizes node communication and facilitates a collaborative approach to computational problem-solving.
​A) In-Row Transaction Validation
​Each row in the grid functions as a "validation team." When a transaction is initiated within a specific row, only the nodes in that row are assigned the task of its validation. This approach replaces individual competition with group collaboration, providing several key advantages:
​Increased Speed: The validation problem is divided among multiple miners and solved collaboratively, significantly reducing the time required for confirmation.
​Reduced Energy Consumption: The computational load is distributed in a parallel fashion, preventing the energy waste associated with a single-winner race.
​Fair Work Distribution: The system efficiently assigns tasks starting with the first miner in the row, ensuring all participating miners contribute to the validation process.
​B) Inter-Row Transaction Validation
​When a transaction is sent from one row to another (e.g., from top to bottom or across columns), "helper miners" are intelligently selected along the path to participate in its validation. These helper miners can move vertically or diagonally to assist, being chosen from the idle or closest available nodes. This mechanism ensures that all nodes in the network remain active and contribute to its efficiency.
​2. Block Structure: Dual-Chained Blocks
​Blocks in this network, unlike the linear chain of Bitcoin, are organized in a grid with (x,y) coordinates. Each block possesses two hashes that link it to two previous blocks in the network:
​Vertical Chain Hash: The hash of the block directly above it in the same column.
​Horizontal Chain Hash: The hash of the block immediately behind it in the same row.
​This two-dimensional structure significantly enhances network security. To tamper with a single block, an attacker would have to simultaneously recalculate the hashes of two different chains, a task that becomes exponentially more difficult. This design is analogous to a building where each brick (block) is connected to both the brick below and the brick next to it, creating a robust and stable structure.
​3. Reward Mechanism and Economic Model
​In this network, miners' rewards are sourced exclusively from transaction fees, not from the creation of new coins. This economic model prevents inflation and directly ties a miner's compensation to their activity within the network.
​Reward Distribution: Each miner's reward is determined by their contribution to solving the problem and the number of collaborating miners in their row. This system prevents the concentration of power and encourages all miners to cooperate.
​Helper Miner Compensation: When an idle miner assists in validating an inter-row transaction, they receive a portion of the reward allocated to the main miner they assisted. This ensures that even "idle" miners are incentivized to contribute and are fairly compensated for their work.
​The "Digital Piggy Bank" System: The fees earned by each miner are collected in a "digital piggy bank" and paid out on a monthly basis. This method standardizes payments and allows miners to accumulate small fees over time.
​4. Solutions to Potential Challenges
​This architecture includes adaptive and automated solutions to address common blockchain issues:
​Challenge 1: Declining Miner Population: Should the number of miners decrease, the system automatically lowers the puzzle difficulty to maintain network stability. Rewards are proportionally adjusted to keep the network balanced.
​Challenge 2: Idle Miners: Miners not directly involved in in-row validation automatically become helper miners, ensuring they remain active in the network.
​Challenge 3: Network Coordination: The number of columns is limited (e.g., 100) for better management. Additionally, "Parent and Mother Nodes" are periodically and randomly selected from among the ordinary miners to act as supervisors, ensuring network coordination. These roles rotate continuously to make them difficult to target.
​Challenge 4: Sybil Attacks: To prevent a single entity from controlling a row or column, all miners must complete a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process before joining the network. This enhances network security and integrity.
​Conclusion
​The Grid-based Blockchain Network represents a significant step toward solving the blockchain trilemma. By intelligently combining a structured grid architecture, dual-chained blocks, and adaptive mechanisms, this design simultaneously achieves reduced energy consumption, increased transaction speed, and enhanced security. This network offers a novel approach that could serve as a foundation for next-generation blockchain technology.
