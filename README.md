# Layered Grid-based Blockchain Network

## Overview
This project implements a **Layered Grid-based Blockchain Network**, a novel blockchain architecture that organizes nodes in rows and columns for improved **speed**, **energy efficiency**, and **security**.  
The system uses **row-based validation**, **helper miners** for idle or cross-row transactions, and **dual-chained blocks** with coordinates (x, y). Rewards are distributed based on contribution and helper participation.

> For full technical details, see the accompanying white paper.

## Technology
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Core Concepts:** Nodes, Blocks, Transactions, Grid-based Mining, Adaptive Difficulty, KYC verification
- **Rewards:** Transaction fees distributed among contributing and helper miners
